# CS3280Assignment2

Assignment #2 for CS-3280 required us to create a console application that requests the user to input 5 full names(first and last). Then once successfully entered, our program must prompt the user to decide if they want the names sorted by first name (which will return a sorted list in the same format as they entered it), or by last name (which will return a format in the form of "[Last], [First]") which will sort alphabetically by last name. Additionally there are some rules for what/how the user can enter which are listed below:

1) If a name has already been previously entered, display an error message and ask the user to re-try.
2) If the user inputs a bad value (not first or last), display an error message and telling them that it is not a valid input and re-prompt the user for a sort order.
3) Once the order is selected output on the console the list of names in the alphabet order specified.
